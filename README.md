# R-projects-Big-Data-courses
Data Science projects executed in R for different courses (some of them executed with other partners):
  * Assignment 1: Data pre-processing and data exploration (missing values, data normalization and scaling, outliers detection, visualization).
  * Assignment 2: Modeling (Decision Tree and Random Forest, KNN, PCA and ROC, K-means).  
  * HW2_R1: Models for sparse data.
  * HW3_Q1: Neural Networks.
  * Final Project: First two questions are statistics and math, without R (Q1: Composition of diﬀerential privacy and diﬀerentially private release of GWAS results; Q2: High dimensional modeling - estimating covariance and predictive modeling). Third question is with R code (Network data analysis).
